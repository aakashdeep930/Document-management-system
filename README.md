# Document management system
As the name suggests this is just a simple document management system providing basic functionalities, the purpose of this
mini-project was not to make a full-fledged completely functional document manegement system, instead i just wanted to learn about basic java libraries and how to work with them.

The only major problem with this project is that we had to interact with the OS to facilitate adding, updating, deleting files and directories through our application, we had to use a java Runtime object to help us with these tasks but that meant our project could no longer be run on windows as we had to use linux only commands and features like mkdir,rm,gedit etc.

### Running the project
After cloning the project or downloading it, use netbeans to open the project and then you are good to go !! Use the application as you like, or maybe if you just wanted to look into the source code for your own mini-project then you can look into the src folder to draw inspiration for your own use.
